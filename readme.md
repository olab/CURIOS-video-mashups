## Description:

CURIOS is a standalone web-service but it works well with OpenLabyrinth for managing roles, access and slugs. 

CURIOS is a video mashup generator for YouTube videos. 

You can create slugs which are metadata pointers to segments of existing YouTube videos, with a start time, end time. 

You can also annotate the video or add a second sound track. 

The slug code that is generated can be inserted into HTML source code in a wide variety of applications such as WordPress, Moodle, OpenLabyrinth, OLab4. 

The original YouTube video is not altered at all. While we suggest that you ask the owner of the original YouTube video for permission to link to their video in this way, but in most regions, this is not required and is not a breach of copyright. The original YouTube video must permit embedding for this mashup service to work.
